Recent graduate from the University of Texas at Austin
BSA in Neuroscience with a minor in Science Communication

After realizing research wasn't a fit for me, I took journalism classes and found that my true passion lies in communicating. My unique experience in both science and journalism allows me to translate technical material like science and data. I have experience in web development, data analysis, video, and audio.
