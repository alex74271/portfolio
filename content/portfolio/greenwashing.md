Analyzing the sustainable collections of clothing brands highlights how they can be vague and misleading to the consumer.

<!--more-->

Greenwashing is a term for marketing that falsely convinces the customer that a company's products or practices are sustainable. Looking at data from some clothing brands' sustainability-focused apparel shows that the consumer might not be making as much of an eco-friendly decision as they think they are.

For many people, sustainability is becoming a key consideration when purchasing clothing. According to [a 2020 survey by McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/survey-consumer-sentiment-on-sustainability-in-fashion), 67% say a fashion brand's use of sustainable materials is an important purchasing factor.

Many clothing companies are aware of this and are putting out lines or collections that are marketed as sustainable. But the definition of "sustainable" varies between brands and the items often aren't as environmentally-friendly as they're portrayed to be.

An analysis of materials from over 5,000 clothing items from brands like H&M, Nike, and Gap revealed issues with transparency and the myth of "circular" fashion.

A customer looking to be more environmentally-conscious would naturally gravitate towards an item that a brand has marked as "sustainable." It seems like a straightforward purchase that would align with their desires. But how sustainable is defined varies between companies and not all approaches to reducing fashion's impact on climate change are made equal.

One common approach is the use of recycled materials. With synthetic plastic materials like polyester accounting for over [60% of clothing material](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/19/17800654/clothes-plastic-pollution-polyester-washing-machine), all of the brands sold some clothing made with non-virgin plastic.

Logically, a higher ratio of recycled materials means a lower carbon footprint. Though both might be labeled "sustainable", a garment made with 70% recycled materials is better for the environment than one made with 5%. An issue found in some of these brands is that they aren't always transparent with the exact percentage.

To be under Nike's "sustainable materials" category, they say the clothing has to be made with 50% recycled content, but 73% of the products didn't explicitly list what percentage is made from recycled materials. H&M also has a 50% threshold for their "Conscious" products, but not a single one of the clothing descriptions mentioned the ratio of recycled materials.

> 27% of Nike products and 0% of H&M products listed what percentage of the clothing is made from recycled materials.

A lack of transparency makes it difficult for the customer to weigh the actual environmental impact. But how effective is using recycled materials at reducing fashion waste anyways?

Adidas and Tommy Hilfiger emphasize their initiatives towards being a "circular" fashion company. This is the philosophy that clothing should be made to last, reused, created sustainably, and be able to be recycled.

The use of recycled materials is becoming increasingly common in the shift towards an ideal closed-loop system. In the marketing of their sustainable products, many brands highlighted the fact that making use of non-virgin plastic reduces waste and "saves plastic from the ocean."

Yet there's an important caveat to this: clothing can't be infinitely recycled.

Even for natural fibers like cotton, each time the material is recycled, the fibers get shortened, decreasing their quality. This is also the reason that you often don't see clothing made from 100% recycled materials. Clothing including recycled fibers is usually blended with a virgin form of that fiber to increase its quality.

The use of blends poses another obstacle to clothing recycling. The separation required for fabric blends again weakens the fibers, making them less likely to be used again. This is the case even for a pair of pants that might have just 2% elastane.

>58% of all clothing was made using a blend of materials
> 58% of clothing containing recycled materials was made from a blend of materials

Not to mention all of the other possible components like polyester sewing thread, zippers, labels, and even dyesâ€”all of which have to be removed before recycling. Because of these complications, [the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Summary-of-Findings_Updated_1-12-17.pdf) that less than 1% of clothing is made into clothing again, 12% is downcycled into other industrial materials, and 73% goes to the landfill or incinerator.

The recycling of clothing rarely happens, and when it does, waste isn't being "saved from the ocean," it's merely being delayed in its trip to the landfill. As it stands, a closed-loop fashion industry is far from being achieved and recycling can't be the only strategy towards sustainability. 

The move towards using organically-grown cotton is also becoming common. 

The definition of organic cotton can vary based on what certification is used, but typically organic cotton uses natural pesticides and fertilizers and lacks genetic modification. Avoiding the use of toxic chemicals prevents possible spillover into the surrounding environment.

But the downside of organic cotton is that less-effective pesticides and fertilizers and no genetic modification means the crop has less yield, which in turn makes it more resource-intensive. Organic cotton produces less per plant, making it more costly in land and water use in order to produce the same amount conventionally-grown cotton would.
 
Conventional cotton is already known to be greedy in its use of water. Producing one kilogram of cotton requires 20,000 liters of water.

Consumers looking to reduce the footprint of their closets would be attracted to marketing that uses terms like "sustainable", "recycled", "circular", or "organic." But in reality, these terms are vague and can be misleading because they don't tell the full story of the clothing's environmental impact.
