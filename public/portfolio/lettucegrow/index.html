         <h1>Efficient Gardening Towers Push the Limits of Agriculture</h1>
         <p><em>By Alex Contreras</em></p>
<p><strong>AUSTIN, Texas</strong> - A university invested in sustainable agriculture technology in hopes of serving as an inspirational model for the future of farming.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/lettucegrow.png" alt="lettucegrow.png"></p>
<p>A grant approved by the University of Texas at Austin led to the purchase of Lettuce Grow <a href="https://lettucegrow.com/">garden towers</a>, which grow food efficiently and sustainably. Technologies like these towers challenge the status quo of present-day farming, allowing universities like UT to fulfill their goal of being a hub for innovation.</p>
<p>Neil Kaufman, sustainability coordinator for Housing and Dining at UT, said, “We felt like we could do a better job in our Jester gardens of using the space to tell the story of what sustainable agriculture can and should look like.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lettucegrow.com/the-farmstand">towers</a> are able to grow produce like broccoli, spinach, kale, and mixed greens 4 to 5 times faster than traditional in-ground farming. They are also 95% more water-efficient, 90% more space-efficient, avoid runoff, and extend the time frame of seasonal plants. The efficiency and productivity provided benefits the university kitchens, and in turn, the customers.</p>
<p>“The tower addresses all of [the inputs in food production],” said Kaufman.</p>
<p>Urban agriculture like the university gardens have a <a href="https://www.theecologycenter.org/10-ways-urban-farms-benefit-the-community/">positive impact</a> on the environment. Gardens in cities can act as a carbon sink, meaning it transfers carbon out of the air and into the plants that are then eaten. Growing produce within cities also brings it closer to its final destination, thus cutting back on transportation emissions.</p>
<p>“There&rsquo;s numerous ways that [urban agriculture] does affect carbon and the climate. It is significant for sure,” said Kaufman.</p>
<p>As efficient as they are, Kaufman warns to not think of the towers as a purchase made in order to turn a profit. In reality, with the cost of the tower itself, servicing, and the seedlings, they could turn out to be slightly more expensive than in-ground gardening. Instead, the towers should be thought of as an effort and minor sacrifice towards becoming more sustainable.</p>
<p>“A better way to think of it is in terms of what non-tangible, abstract, and concrete thing can we provide for the community and our students,” said Kaufman.</p>
<p>Kaufman has had students and staff show interest in the towers. The sight of the towers catches people’s eyes, gets them asking questions, and fosters a productive conversation on the importance of sustainability in agriculture.</p>
<p>“I would suspect that it also inspires students to engage with food in a way that&rsquo;s maybe different or more complex than just with a fork and knife,” said Kaufman.</p>
<p>Universities are often thought of as being on the cutting-edge. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/4-ways-universities-are-driving-innovation/">Innovation</a> that takes place at universities shows everyone else the possibilities of advancement.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;re a research institution. We have a role to play in our society which is to challenge things and go beyond in the scary spaces or in dangerous places,” said Kaufman.</p>
<p>It is the duty of a university to serve as an ideal model, something to strive for. The population can then be inspired to change for the better, especially in the case of agriculture, which has seen little innovation in over 10,000 years according to Kaufman.</p>
<p>“What these towers do, in my opinion, is to demonstrate a little bit of [risk-taking] to our population with students that are already primed for new information, new ideas,” said Kaufman.</p>
<p>People in places of power need to be aware of a large amount of public support on a topic before they’re encouraged to do something about it. Efforts to garner public interest in sustainability like these towers are an important first step towards <a href="https://www.agrilinks.org/post/how-policy-change-happens">policy changes</a> and research.</p>
